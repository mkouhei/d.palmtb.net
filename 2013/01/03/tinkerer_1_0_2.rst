Debian package of Tinkerer 1.0.2
================================

`Tinkerer 1.0 was released last December 16 <http://www.tinkerer.me/2012/12/16/tinkerer_1_0_released.html>`_. Tinkerer is supported both python2 and python3, so I have packaged Debian package of python2 and python3, and uploaded to mentors.debian.net.

It does not become the official package, why it is not yet able to resolve the issue of the license.

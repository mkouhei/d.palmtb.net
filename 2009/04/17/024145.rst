KVM #2
======

`The article of KVM #2 <http://www.atmarkit.co.jp/flinux/rensai/kvm02/kvm02a.html>`_  was released the day before yesterday. My having wanted to write most this time is a setting of the bridging connection with the TAP device. I wrote because I had not seen comprehensible material with the illustration up to now.

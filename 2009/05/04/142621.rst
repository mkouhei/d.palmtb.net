file name changed that UPPER to lower.
======================================

The file name should be a small letter of Hatena Fotolife. However, Canon Inc. IXY DIGITAL 820 IS as my digicam generates the file name of the capital letter. Then, I wrote the script that converted the file name.


.. code-block:: sh


   #!/bin/sh
    
   for i in *
   do
    mv $i `echo $i | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'`
   done
    
   exit 0

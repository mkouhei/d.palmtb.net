I went to my old school in 10 years.
====================================

Today, I went to my graduated university to request for issuing a diploma. I first visit there after graduation in 10 years. My alma mater is Tokyo metropolitan university. Although old school has changed a little too in 10 years, was a nostalgic scene. 



After I graduated, my alma mater merged with other universities, had changed from "東京都立大学" to "首都大学東京" also called name of the University in Japanese. But I noticed English name is "Tokyo Metropolitan University" has not changed either. I was a little relieved.



I also wanted to visit the lab and helped me in graduate studies, professor of teacher had been already transferred to other universities. It is up I thought I should have visited sooner. What is done cannot undone.

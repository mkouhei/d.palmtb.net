===================================================



I bought a new wireless router that is NEC WR8500N. I had mistaken. WR8500N dose not have WPA2 instead of WPA-PSK AES.

Then I did setup, but Debian on MacBook Air failed WPA-PSK authentication of 4 way handshake, then timeout and retry repeated endlessly. But chumby succeeded.

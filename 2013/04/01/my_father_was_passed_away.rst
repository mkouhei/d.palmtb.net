My father was passed away
=========================

My father was passed away on the 20th last March.
He had difficulty disease. It was too late to cure the disease when his disease has found. 

I went to visit my father in the hospital with his daughter about 2 weeks before my father died was the last face-to-face. My father at home until the last minute, do-it-yourself was doing as much as possible on his own. I regret and I should let them meet my daughter to him more. When I went to visit the week before he died, we exchanged words was his father's last words. 

I: "I also come with my wife and daughter in April."

Father: "When you come next I hope to be able to chat with the grandchildren."

I did not fulfill this promise that I have with my father.

Dad, may you rest in peace, we shall never forget you.


**(This is no April fools' joke.)**

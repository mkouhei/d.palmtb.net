  * Other softwares were almost uploads to mentors.debian.net, but were not yet main.

* We had held "Grand union Debian meeting" (`大統一Debian勉強会 <http://gum.debian.or.jp/>`_).

  * I have said "Opening speech", and photo shoot of the day, only.

* I had become a Debian JP leader of this term, but I do not play a role in private is too busy.
* Currently, I have not been able to work my maintenance of the Debian packages.

* Programming and python, python & Debian packaging only I was doing in both public and private.

In summary, child-rearing, nursing my wife, to go home to the parents' frequent were more difficult than expected.


This year
---------

I decided two simply.

First health
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Health break, we would spend all one's time to it. Our daughter, my wife, myself are to stay healthy firstly.

In moderation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What I want to do, that I do not have a lot to do everything this year. Last year only become hands full health aspects of my family, there was a lot of what was untouched. So, I think it is not aiming for 100%, 50%, 0%, and 80%, 80%, 80% would aim a little luck.

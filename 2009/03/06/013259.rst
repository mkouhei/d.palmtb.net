Hardware Clock is UTC when Dual boot of Debian and Windows xp
=============================================================

The system clock of Windows xp is not UTC, but Local Time Clock. I constructed the the dual boot environment in Let's note R3 as Debian GNU/Linux squeeze/sid and Windows xp. I setuped Linux's system time as UTC, then Windows time was forwarded 9 hours.



But, I learned to make Windows use UTC.

   Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

   

   [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\TimeZoneInformation]

        "RealTimeIsUniversal"=dword:00000001
